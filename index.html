  <h2>Trading</h2>
  <p>Trading, in a financial context, is the buying and selling of financial instruments—such as stocks, currencies, and commodities—with the goal of profiting from short-term price fluctuations. This differs from investing, which typically involves buying and holding assets for long-term wealth appreciation. </p>
  <p>How Trading Works</p>
  <p>Traders aim to profit by correctly predicting market price movements. If a trader expects an asset's price to rise, they "go long" (buy); if they expect it to fall, they "go short" (sell).</p>
  <p>Supply and Demand: Prices are driven by supply and demand. More buyers than sellers increase prices, while more sellers than buyers decrease them.</p>
  <p>Derivatives: Many traders, especially retail traders, use derivative products like Contracts for Difference (CFDs). These allow speculation on an asset's price without the trader ever owning the underlying asset.</p>
  <p>Leverage: Derivatives often use leverage, allowing a trader to open a position much larger than their initial deposit. This magnifies both potential profits and losses, making risk management critical.</p>
  <p>Key Markets and Assets</p>
  <p>Traders can access a wide variety of global markets through online platforms.</p>
  <p>Stocks/Shares: Buying and selling ownership stakes in publicly listed companies.</p>
  <p>Forex (Foreign Exchange): The world's largest and most liquid market, involving the exchange of one currency for another (e.g., EUR/USD).</p>
  <p>Commodities: Trading natural resources such as gold, oil, and agricultural products.</p>
  <p>Indices: Trading on a collection of stocks that represent an entire market or sector, like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100.</p>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies: Trading digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>
  <p>Common Trading Styles</p>
  <p>A trader's style depends on their time commitment, risk tolerance, and goals</p>
  <p>Scalping (Micro Trading): A subset of day trading focusing on making many small profits from rapid trades within seconds or minutes.</p>
  <p>Swing Trading: Positions are held for several days to a few weeks to profit from short to medium-term market trends.</p>
  <p>Position Trading: A long-term approach where positions are held for months or years, similar to investing but focusing more on major price trends rather than fundamental ownership.</p>
  <p>Getting Started</p>
  <p>Educate Yourself: Learn about market dynamics, analysis (technical and fundamental), and risk management through educational resources.</p>
  <p>Open a Brokerage Account: You need an account with a regulated broker that provides access to the markets you want to trade.</p>
  <p>Create a Trading Plan: A crucial step that outlines your goals, strategy, and risk tolerance.</p>
  <p>Practice: Many brokers offer demo accounts with virtual funds, allowing you to practice strategies risk-free before using real money</p>
  <p>Practice: Many brokers offer demo accounts with virtual funds, allowing you to practice strategies risk-free before using real money.</p>
  <p>Start Small: Beginners are advised to start with an amount they can afford to lose and gradually increase their capital as confidence and experience grow.</p>
